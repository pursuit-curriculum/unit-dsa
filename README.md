# Module 5: Data Structures & Algorithms

We're almost at the end of our learning journey at Pursuit.

So far, you've learned the needed skills and tech to land your first dev job. Now we're going to focus on helping you refine your skills and help you prepare for a coding interview.

This unit, we'll be working on:

- Reviewing fundamentals
- Improving problem solving skills
- Continue becoming an independent learner
- Practicing talking about code
- Getting an introduction to computer science topics
- Doing mock interviews to help prepare for job interviews

To pass this unit, you will need to gain a minimum number of points on code wars and pass 2 mock interviews.

## Learning Outcomes

- Be able to solve level 8, 7 and 6 Kata on [Code Wars](https://docs.codewars.com/gamification/ranks/) in a reasonable amount of time
- Be able to talk through your solutions to problems
- Be able to teach yourself something new
- Be able to describe, at a very high level, common computer science topics such as Big O and recursion

## Individual Project: Code Wars

Your goal will be to accumulate at certain number of points points on code wars during this module. The more points you acquire the more likely you are to pass a technical interview.

[Ranking system](https://docs.codewars.com/gamification/ranks/)

You will be tracked with [Pursuit's Code Wars Tracker](https://pursuit.codetrack.dev)

## Assessment: Mock Interviews

You will need to pass a minimum of 3 mock interviews. [More details](./mock-interviews)
